## Findings report (final synthesis)

Write in Markdown. One section per theme with a narrative and supporting quotes. Example:

```
### Coordination gaps during emergencies
When emergencies occur, unclear roles slow down response. Participants described delays because no one was sure who would contact support or collect needed materials.

> "People were willing to help, but nobody knew who should call for supplies" (P1)
> "We lost time just figuring out who was in charge" (P2)

### Openness to tools with safety conditions
Participants welcomed new tools if they were simple and safe. Ease of use and low risk were mentioned more often than advanced features.

> "I'll try a new tool if it doesn't get in the way" (P1)
> "If it's safe and easy, I'm happy to use it" (P3)
```


## Quote handling

- Keep original wording even if ungrammatical.
- If a quote is too long, replace removed spans with "...".
- Do not change wording beyond the ellipsis replacement.
