# Thematic Analysis Workflow

## Step-by-step

1. Scope the analysis.
   - Confirm research question (if present) and data type (interviews, surveys, notes).
   - Determine unit of analysis (sentence, turn, or short phrase) based on clarity.

2. Prepare the data lightly.
   - Keep original wording; do not fix grammar unless meaning is unclear.
   - If transcripts are unstructured, use short turns or sentences as coding units.
   - If the user provides no participant list, label participants as P1, P2, P3... by transcript order.

3. Initial coding (open coding).
   - Assign codes to meaning-bearing units.
   - Use concise code names that reflect the idea, not the exact wording.
   - Keep codes distinct; avoid near-duplicates.

4. Theme development (axial grouping).
   - Cluster codes into themes that capture a broader pattern.
   - Write a 1-2 sentence definition per theme.
   - Verify each theme has supporting quotes from participants.

5. Review and refine.
   - Check theme distinctiveness and internal coherence.
   - Merge or split themes if needed.
   - Ensure coverage across participants where appropriate.

## Quality checks

- Coverage: are all major ideas captured by codes?
- Coherence: do quotes within a theme fit together?
- Distinctiveness: are themes clearly different from each other?
- Traceability: can every theme be traced back to specific quotes?
