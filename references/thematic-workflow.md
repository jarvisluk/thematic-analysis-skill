# Thematic Analysis Workflow

This workflow gives you a practical sequence for producing traceable codes,
themes, and findings from qualitative text. Use the data familiarization output
as an anchor: it improves consistency during coding and gives you a stable
baseline for theme coverage checks.

## Step-by-step

1. Scope the analysis.
   - Confirm research question (if present) and data type (interviews, surveys, notes).
   - Determine unit of analysis (sentence, turn, or short phrase) based on clarity.

2. Prepare the data lightly.
   - Keep original wording; do not fix grammar unless meaning is unclear.
   - If transcripts are unstructured, use short turns or sentences as coding units.
   - If the user provides no participant list, label participants as P1, P2, P3... by transcript order.

3. Data familiarization (read-through).
   - Read through all transcripts once before you start coding.
   - Record a brief that captures:
     - overall narrative and scope boundaries
     - a vocabulary list (common terms, synonyms, in-domain phrases)
     - candidate directions (not finalized themes)
     - anomalies (off-topic sections, missing answers, repeated boilerplate)
   - Do not assign codes or name themes in this step.
   - Use the familiarization brief to:
     - reduce code drift across transcripts
     - spot gaps when you finalize themes

4. Initial coding (open coding).
   - Assign codes to meaning-bearing units.
   - Use concise code names that reflect the idea, not the exact wording.
   - Keep codes distinct; avoid near-duplicates.

5. Theme development (axial grouping).
   - Cluster codes into themes that capture a broader pattern.
   - Write a 1-2 sentence definition per theme.
   - Verify each theme has supporting quotes from participants.

6. Review and refine.
   - Check theme distinctiveness and internal coherence.
   - Merge or split themes if needed.
   - Ensure coverage across participants where appropriate.

## Quality checks

- Coverage: are all major ideas captured by codes?
- Coherence: do quotes within a theme fit together?
- Distinctiveness: are themes clearly different from each other?
- Traceability: can every theme be traced back to specific quotes?
- Drift: do themes and codes stay consistent with the familiarization brief?
